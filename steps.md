1. first create a repo and get the data in there
2. create a python virtual environment for our project
    This is done by changing to an anaconda environment `$ pyenv shell miniconda3-4.3.30`
    and then use `mkvirutalenv` to create the env
    `$ pyenv virtualenvwrapper`
    `$ mkvirtualenv btc-ml`
    now keep in mind, whenever we start this project we need to `workon btc-ml`
3. start a jupyter notebook
4. install all libraries as needed using either `conda` or `pip`
    since we are already working in anaconda we will use `conda`
